There is conflicting information from both sides but nothing warranting further investigation. Child safety specialist was consulted during the closure process and concurred no major violation occurred that would warrant a CPS report. Essentially, PG and LS claim that issues with BS' ""character"" and personality had a persistent and negative effect on the match and culminated during their final meeting at the zoo. PG and LS failed to report any of these issues, nor their seriousness, in any MSC's going back over 18 months. PG and LS claim BS is controlling, judgmental, and unwilling to accommodate LS' needs related to her mental health. PG said that they never developed a strong bond. Again, previous MSC's from all parties directly or implicitly refute nearly all of these claims. The ""breaking point"" occurred when LS desired to go home during their most recent meetup, citing her discomfort with being around BS' family that made her feel left out. PG and LS accuse BS of ignoring LS' request and ignoring PG's outreach over the phone during this meetup. BS' statement contradicts this account and shows that PG and BS were in contact during the meetup and that BS was actively trying to find a solution to an issue that has been persistent in their relationship. LS would experience mood swings, possibly related to her bipolar disorder/social anxiety, and BS had been asking for support on how best to handle this for several months, or longer. BS said that she and PG had several conversations about how to choose when to accommodate LS when she wants to leave or quit something vs. encouraging her to ""push through"" and stick with something. PG and LS had no desire to work through this issue and requested immediate closure with no contact from BS. I agreed to do so. It is difficult to accurately assign responsibility for why this match has fallen apart. BS clearly violated the BBBS guideline of 1-1 meetups but was willing to take accountability for this. BS also admitted on several occassions that she was struggling to support LS as she was experiencing symptoms of very serious mental health disorders. BS was willing to accept coaching from BBBS and PG and there is ample evidence that she had requested this from both parties. I have found several examples of BS requesting resources from BBBS and advocating for LS. She was more communicative and engaged with BBBS than most Bigs. On the other hand, PG and LS repeatedly violated the 1-1 guideline as well. The major difference being that they seemed to actively withhold this information from BBBS during MSC's. BS reported that their families had multiple interactions with each other and she never received any negative feedback about this from PG or LS. Considering the gravity of the character flaws and behavior PG and LS described during their last MSC, it's difficult to comprehend how almost nothing was mentioned during the 3.5 years leading up to closure. To conclude, I agree that closure is the best way forward for everyone invollved. PG cited that she is still grateful for BBBS and the match. She said that it essentially boiled down to clash of personalities and a lack of a deep bond. BS is shocked and remorseful. I was surprised, based on the picture painted by PG and LS, that BS was so receptive to their feedback about her behavior. BS took accountability and apologized. I will not encourage BS to reenroll, but I will not discourage her if she shows interest and advocates for herself.

Both took a little bit of time to warm up initially, but became very engaging and fun-loving. Shared Interests: socializing with friends, reading, active, arts/crafts.

Additional Info: A little bit of background why EMC is making this match: LS is adopted to 2 white moms, but moms really want LS to have a strong, black female role model for LS because they understand they aren't able to fill that role. With the adoption transition, they want someone who she can identify with and look up to. Because LS comes from a tougher background, moms do not want her perception of being Black tied with her mother's past thus reaching out to the program for the 1:1 role. BS is a independent, hard-working, driven black female. She is passionate about social justice, race, and providing guidance to young, black girls. She understands what it means to not only be Black in the country, but also an immigrant. EMC believes both fill what the other are looking for in terms of making that impact. Another thing to note is the family has plans to move to CA in the next year or two, and BS is finishing her residency in MN around the same time (Summer 2020) and isn't sure what her plans are after -- she mentioned potentially moving back to NYC. EMC believes this will work out very nicely to each other's potential schedules, while still giving them enough time to enjoy an impactful relationship.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Female,Black or African American,2010-08-01 00:00:00,2.7053E+11,2.70531E+11,,12.5

In May of June 2019, they wanted to support their Little Rae?Kwon above and beyond the scope of the program but checked in with MEC prior to see if it would be possible within the program boundaries. MEC said, ?No? and B_first_name said she would check to see if it would even be possible for the Homeless and Highly mobile transportation to pick Rae?Kwon at B_first_name & Marek?s house. (They were going to have Rae?Kwon stay with them for a few weeks to help him focus better in school vs having to transition daily from a day shelter to a night shelter.) B_first_name did not communicate back with MEC about whether they would move forward or not. MEC spoke with the kids and there was a miscommunication that led to immediate closure. MEC understood that Rae?Kwon was already staying with B_first_name & Marek when he actually wasn?t. MEC closed the match immediately and then B_first_name, Marek, and Marquita (mom) confirmed that Rae?Kwon was not actually staying with them and it didn?t work out to get transportation anyway.

In September 2021, PG initiated match closure as BS could not consistently be there for LB; their communication and outings were sporadic, BS had health issues and cared for an ailing family member; LB was losing trust in the relationship when trust is a core issue due to being abandoned by his parents in early childhood. COVID also contributed to these mismatched expectations, and PG began to grown more and more frustrated with BS's sporadic communication. In October 2021, PG's concerns led her to confirm the decision to close the match with LB's therapist as well as with MEC who agreed that the match ""wasn't working"" for LB or PG. PG talked with LB and he would like a rematch if possible, with a BB, BS or BC. MEC explained that there are no guarantees but this may be an option depending on the decision of EMT. *MEC recognizes that this match closure is far outside the bounds of 'timeliness' and will prioritize faster timing in future match closures.*Rematch Child (Y/N): ????? *Reason: ?????Y, LB is now 13 y/o but according to PG, didn't get a chance to settle into a long term, positive match as there were many interruptions (BS illness, COVID limitations, etc.) PG hoped for a rematch and at the time MEC submitted a rematch request rematches for LB's were on hold. MEC will ask one more time in January 2022 to see if stats have changed in LB's area. PG (and LB) are highly motivated to have LB matched with a Big as a way to ""build trust with a healthy adult.""

BS B_first_name has always kept her distance though and PG feels like with the pandemic it has gotten worse. They used to rarely meet and PG stated she?d informed another MEC prior to me that she wanted to close this match due to lack of engagement from BS. B_first_name doesn?t reach out to PG and PG feels like even though they?ve been match since 2018 there?s no quality to the match. LS reports really only going to McDonald?s and the park with BS. PG would like for them to try different things but BS is not really like that. PG stated the match had signed up for ice fishing but it was at PG?s constant request before BS actually registered for the event. MEC will go ahead and close the match and submit doc for reassessment. MEC confirmed current contact information and updated info in MF. 2) Summarize any child safety concerns: NA 3) Rematch Child (Y/N): Y ? Reason: PG was a LS when she was young and remembers and still keeps in touch with her BS because of the bond they had. PG would like for daughter?s BS to be engaging and more creative with match activity ideas. PG stated it just felt like they were more hanging out not really getting depth to their match relationship. 4) Rematch Volunteer (Y/N): N ? Reason: MEC has not heard from BS since 8/26 and she made contact with BBBS staff in Nov. At request of PG due to continued feelings of lack in the match MEC decided to close this match.

He wasn't able to name specifically why he didn't reach out and continue with Match/Program. He vaguely said ""communication fell through, it wasn't my fault or their fault."" MEC ask him to provide specifics (i.e. communication with mom, connection with LB, etc...). BB was not able to give MEC a reason. He let MEC know that he is stepping out of the program. MEC called mom back and let her know that MEC reached BB, and will be closing Match. She asked if LB can get a new Big. MEC let mom know she put the request in, and will keep her updated. 2) Summarize any child safety concerns: No child safety concerns reported.  3) Rematch Child (Y/N): Pending- MEC will wait to hear back from EMT, and will keep PG updated. ? Reason: See above. 4) Rematch Volunteer (Y/N): No ? Reason: BB is stepping out of program and cannot commit to program. He was not able to commit to program after a few months in the program. ?

BS did not feel she wanted to keep the match going for that reason, and because she felt that there never was a bond formed. It was hard to tell who was picturing the match correctly.

Lb really wanted a BB although he and his Grandmother did say Bs would be okay. They had lots of complaints about Bs always having the match do things with other people, however this is not how Bs described what they did. She always said they wen to actiities where there were other kids there.. such as activities at a Fire Station where she knew people. Lb said that Bs was always correcting his speech. In the initial notes, it was noted by the matching worker that Bs did this at the match meeting,although it was not seen as mean spirited, it did seem a tad out of place at a first meeting. Grandmother had lots of complaints about Bs, and Bs said that grandmother never seemed to know her name, and was rude to her. I really tried to encourage the match, but I just think they did not get along. Lb seems to be a nice kid, and honestly just wants someone to do things with.. He said a female again would be okay if she were nice,but he really wants a male. Lb and Grandmother both say they want Lb to be rematched. I have to say that Bs seemed quite enthusiastic about the match, and I did have to frequently encourage her to call and make plans for the match I would not recommend Bs to be rematched.

They got matched right when covid hit in March, and so they have not been able to stay connected virtually and in person. MEC has been in communication with both PG and BB about ways to stay engaged. Somehow, it seemed they didn?t reach out to each other. Match was able to have one in person outing, and then PG decided to pull LB from program. From experience while checking in, MEC thinks that both PC and BB are busy on their end, and the match/program was probably not a priority for them to make it work. Also, virtual mentoring did not work for Match, as LB is not into it. As for the in-person mentoring, BB was busy planning for wedding and other obligations. PG works long hours, and LB has other extracurricular activities to participate in. 2) Summarize any child safety concerns: No child safety concerns reported.  3) Rematch Child (Y/N): No ?

All parties agreed that the match struggled during COVID. BC are a bit older faced a higher risk of a serious outcome. The match paused in-person meetups and struggled to stay closely in touch virtually. As restrictions were lifted, planning and communication struggled to get back to normal. I tried to coach both sides, but to no avail. BB decided he had lost interest in the match and wanted to focus his efforts elsewhere. BB also felt like LB was losing interest. Both sides accused each other of being poor at planning and following through with commitments. I tried to encourage BB to take part in a positive match closure process, but he rejected the idea and put it all on me. This was very disappointing.

MEC last had contact with PG and LS in July 2021, but no response from them since. Contact was last completed with BS in November 2021 and at the time she confirmed that she had not seen LS in person since Summer 2021. Their relationship is largely text-only at this point due to COVID and other external circumstances; she wasn't able to reach LS via text for several months until she received a message from LS in December 2021. MEC initiated match closure because neither PG nor LS responded to increasing attempts at contact; a sibling match closed last year for noncompliance (communication). MEC did consistent outreach with all match parties to complete support, and later to discuss match closure with BS, emphasizing that the match may have 'outgrown' the structure of formal BBBS programming and that without our ability to ensure child safety, the match could not stay formally enrolled. In order to ensure healthy match closure, MEC did make consistent, 3+ attempts at contact with LS and family. Also, MEC offered more details about BBBS Alumni Programming and kept the tone of match closure positive and celebratory as the match has been together for 36+ months, which is considered a success. According to BS, match is expected to maintain informal contact via SMS outside the formal supervision of BBBS. Summarize any child safety concerns: None documented/reported. Rematch Child (Y/N): ????? *Reason: ?????N, LS is now 14 y/o and has ""aged out"" of matchable age. Moreover, she benefitted from 36+ months matched with a Big Sister in our program. Moreover, PG was not responsive to many attempts at contact throughout 2021. Alumni programming would be a good opt-in for LS if she can maintain contact with alumin coordinator. Rematch Volunteer (Y/N): ????? *Reason: ?????Y, BS was an engaged and consistent volunteer for many, many months and demonstrated flexibility and positivity in her match. She would need to demonstrate availability since she has had more constrained time and availability in more recent months. She would also need to recommit to expectations for required communication in the program and show a willingness to form a new relationship with a new Little.

With LS moving from Aunt's to bio-Mom's care/custody around February 2021, consistent contact and LS's interest waned.

BS is a little bit older than LS wanted, but BS is energetic, active and youthful. LS did not circle many things on the IF but would do well being introduced to new activities. BS may need some patience in the beginning while LS opens up. Overall, they both have a love for the outdoors, animals, and hands on activities.",CB Volunteer Enrollment,2020-01-15 00:00:00,2020-01-20 00:00:00,,,11,,,0,,,,,,,2019-12-04 00:00:00,2019-12-12 00:00:00,,Divorced,,1,1,2018-08-12 00:00:00,,2020-02-10 00:00:00,2020-03-16 00:00:00,None/Other,Bike Riding; Flying Kites,"Ceramics/Clay; Crafts; Drawing; Jewelry Making; Models: Cars, Planes; Painting; Photography; Sewing/Knitting",Gym; Humane Society; Out to eat; Parks; Zoo,Cooking,Dancing; Laser Tag; Movies; Singing,,,,Quiet/shy,,Female,Other,2010-03-01 00:00:00,2.7053E+11,2.70371E+11,,10

Then in the winter Bs was grappling with wanting to move on, work, school, and didn't think she could continue the match. MEC did try to find some solutions to this with Big. Big had been seeing LB almost every week,and MEC did try to convince BS that once a month would be just great. When MEC return from leave, Guardian told me that Bs had met with she and LB, and told them about her deciding to close the match. They did talk about keeping in touch, and it did sound as if BS did do a good job of telling Lb and guardian. I tried numerous times and ways to contact BS, but never heard back from her. She was difficult to reach as it was, and it sounded as if she just wanted to end the match at one year, which is what happened. I did try to see if LB could be rematched, but was told that we could not. Lb seemed to do so well with the Bs(he is autistic) but regressed after match was closed. I had mother write a letter requesting rematch also. It was felt that this was not a good reason to be rematched.. I did tell mother that we were unable to rematch LB.I referred her to the Autism Society as they had a listing for a mentoring program , that was in a pilot phase in 2019. I cannot find that letter, but it was sent.

Didn?t feel like Little wanted to be in the program and did it for fear of what grandma wanted. L_first_name expressed on one occasion that she wasn?t feeling well even after B_first_name had arrived at the house to pick her up but after a short while L_first_name came out reluctantly and B_first_name feels that grandma forced L_first_name to go??grandma is a matriarch?. After being out on the activity though in that occasion L_first_name quickly stated she wanted to go back home and so B_first_name took her home right after they ate. 2) Summarize any child safety concerns: NA  3) Rematch Child (N): ? Reason: Child does not like to participate in in-person or virtual opportunities presented. Child is disengaged and progrom 1:1 may not be the right fit at this time. 4) Rematch Volunteer (N): ? Reason: Uncoachable. She was with another MEC prior to me (Raquel) and struggled with us both in listening to different cultural views and understanding her own bias.

They have been matched for over three and half years, but they have not seen each other in quiet awhile.

LB is not living in Eden Prairie and he isn?t planning to continue with BBBS or meeting with his BB. Nothing happened and there are no concerns over the decision to close the match. It sounds as though Mom is not very supportive of the BBBS program and does not feel LB needs a mentor, thus that most likely plays a role in LB decision to close his match. BB told LB that he can always call him and he would be happy to get together again, if LB ever wanted to. This is a positive match closure with all parties understanding and okay with the decision to close the match 2) Summarize any child safety concerns: None  3) Rematch Child (Y/N): N ?

Describe the reasons for closure and any extenuating circumstances: This match is closing because Big is moving to Northern MN. He did a great job (with limited notice for him even) letting MEC know that he would be moving and to figure out how to tell his Little. LB had just lost his dad and has been through a lot this past year. MEC spoke with both Little, PG and Big about the closure and everyone seemed to understand why and there was no internalizing of the closure reason. LB was able to help Big move his things so this was very clear that it?s what happened. BB moved for a new job. 2. Summarize any child safety concerns: There are no child safety concerns other than Little just lost his father and is currently living in a hotel. MEC is very hopeful he can get another Big. PG is great about keeping all the mentors in the loop. 3. Rematch Child (Y/N): ??Yes??? ? Reason: ?????L_first_name has had 2 Bigs that have moved. His family is very well connected to BBBS and he should definitely get a Big. L_first_name recently lost his dad and his family had a house fire and is staying in a hotel.

No similar interest, age and health limitations of Bigs, and disrespect issues in the match has resulted in all parties wanting to discontinue the match. MEC has agreed to do so after telling all parties reality of this decision and that there is no guarantee that LB will be rematched. PG and LB are willing to accept that chance. I will not recommend Bigs for re-engagement per their request. BB feels that with his age and health concerns, he might not be able to do all the things needed of him as a BB.

Describe the reasons for closure and any extenuating circumstances: LS has never really seemed all that interested in having a BS. There have been several conversations throughout the match about LS?s interest; if she wanted a BS, reminding her to respond to BS?s contact attempts, etc. LS always said she wanted to have a BS and wanted to continue, but her actions didn?t match her words. LS?s Mom even mentioned that she thought maybe LS and BS were not a good fit, but LS said they were and she wanted to continue. Due to lack of communication from LS, BS finally decided it was time to close the match. BS kept trying and trying, but the match really was not going anywhere. Now that BS is going back to school, she has limited time and if LS isn?t interested, she wants to focus her time elsewhere. BS said that if LS had been really into the match, she would have loved to continue, even with starting school again. Overall, there were no issues, nothing negative happened in the match, LS just wasn?t interested in the program. 2. Summarize any child safety concerns: No concerns. 3.

Describe the reasons for closure and any extenuating circumstances. Include more details: B_first_name and L_first_name were matched in March of 2021. They met in the community based program for seven months. Their match got off to a rocky start because B_first_name was changing apartments. PC asked at the match meeting if she would be able to commit to commuting from Minneapolis to Eden Prairie for meetings 2-4 times a month? B_first_name said yes. In practice, this was challenging for B_first_name though. During the seven months they were matched B_first_name brought up a number of concerns about L_first_name and the match. I think she might have had trouble not sweating the small stuff and being flexible/adaptable as a mentor. Also, I do not think she was patient. PC addressed concerns, brainstormed solutions, and help B_first_name reflect. Each match support was about 30-45 minutes long (See MS for details). B_first_name shared with PC that she was struggling with mental health a couple months into the match and that she was working 10 hour days. Both of these things conflicted with her ability to follow through on the commitment she made to L_first_name. One month B_first_name did not meet with L_first_name at all because she ?completely forgot.? It seems like the time they did have together had good moments (hikes in park, BBBS droning event) and challenging moments (L_first_name talking frequently about her fears). The match closed because B_first_name got a new job in San Francisco and she will be moving. PC had a closure conversation with B_first_name on 10/6/21. PC had a closure conversation with Rebecca (PG) and L_first_name on 10/8/21. B_first_name and L_first_name?s last meeting was on 10/10/21. They met in-person and went on a hike. It sounds like the last meeting was positive. ? Summarize any child safety concerns: None. Though B_first_name noted that L_first_name liked to talk about her fears a lot and this was challenging for her. ? Rematch Child (Y/N): Yes.? *Reason: ?Rebecca (PG) was very good about communicating with BBBS. Both Rebecca and L_first_name want a re-matched. From Match Support PC could tell L_first_name enjoyed the program. Both L_first_name and Rebecca said BBBS was a really positive experience. ? Rematch Volunteer (Y/N): No.????? *Reason: ?B_first_name is moving to San Francisco. However, I would not recommend her for a re-match at this moment. This is due to her mental health, the amount of hours she works, and her not being able to follow expectations about meeting 2-4 a month. ?

Big arrived outside and waited for 15+ for Little to come down from the apartment. Big shared that she was tired of waiting (all the time) and left. Little noticed that Big was leaving and told her Mom. Mom Joletta noticed it and tried calling Big (multiple times) but Big decided to not pick up. When MEC brought this up to Big, she shared that she didn't pick up because she was not in the right mindset to do so. Mom was furious and Little is sad. MEC brought up the timing of Little getting ready, as Big shared that Little takes a while to come downstairs. Mom shared that Little takes a while to get ready as she is 10 years old. Mom also shared that it takes her a while to get ready during the winter because she has to put a lot on. MEC understood the situation. MEC asked if Big comes up to the apartment to get Little, to which Mom stated ""no"". Mom said she waits in her car outside the apartment for Little to come down. MEC asked if Mom had this conversation with Big, which she said she did but Big wouldn't do it because Big has knee injuries. In December, when MEC called Big, Big shared that she has not reached out to Mom and will not do so, unless Mom reaches out first. MEC connected with Mom and she shared that she did but Big never answered, so she will wait for Big to reach out instead. Due to the lack of communication, both Big and Mom would like to close the match.

The match started off strong and all of the adults concurred that LB was having a good time. A few months in, communication and planning issues arose with frequent cancellations and long delays in replying (mostly PG and LB). We tried to resolve this issues and I provided BC with months of coaching. Despite the adjustments made by BC, PG and LB seemed to pull away more abruptly until one day, somewhat out of the clue, PG informed BC and I that LB was no longer interested in the match. It took me (MEC) several days and attempts to complete a follow up with LB to get a better understanding. Finally, LB and PG shared with me that LB doesn't want to be in a BC match and that he was not interested in continuing with BB or BS in a 1-1 relationship. PG and LB would like to be rematched, but I have serious reservations about their request. I do not think they took the program very seriously. Summarize any child safety concerns: NA Rematch Child (Y/N): PG and LB requested a reenroll. I can't say with 100% certainty that they shouldn't be reenrolled, but I do not think they a strong candidate for this consideration. ????? *Reason: communication and planning issues; confusing communication and justification regarding match closure?????

He looked for MEC?s advice, we talked, and MEC gave him some time to think it through and make a decision. He reached out and let MEC know that he is not going to continue his match.

Include more details: This match closed at Big's request. Big felt that it was not a good match. They struggled to come up with activities that they both felt good about - Little wanted to do higher cost things like going shopping or getting nails done, and Big took that as Little ""wanted to spend money instead of hanging out"". However, whenever they, for example, went on a walk, they seemed to have a good time. Big would still focus on Little's interest in higher-cost activities instead of suggesting more free/low cost. The other issue was that Big felt that Little was not engaged enough overall. Big was disappointed that Little was not very affectionate or enthusiastic about seeing Big. Big was not coachable around adjusting expectations or understanding that different kids take different amounts of time to warm up/get comfortable with an adult. Big would say that she understands that some kids might take a while, but she expected *something* from Little. Overall, Big had particular expectations of Little which were not met and Big was reluctant to truly change her expectations or be the driver in the relationship. Summarize any child safety concerns: None Rematch Child (Y/N): Y????? *Reason: PG asked for a new Big; I am talking with Little this weekend to get her perspective. It's hard to tell exactly how engaged Little was in the relationship because Big didn't feel she was, but Little always had positive things to say about Big and their activities/time together in MSCs. I think with a Big willing to be consistent, creative, patient, and comfortable with redirecting when Little is wanting to shop or do other higher-cost activities, Little would do well.

It is bittersweet to hear that the match is reaching a natural closure but I do hope you are able to cherish the memories made! Also congrats on the addition to your family! :) Here?s some things to keep in mind as you start to close your match: Check in with both Melinda and L_first_name to let them know your thoughts on formally closing out the match and your expectations, if any, for staying connected. Plan a formal acknowledgement or celebration of the match?this can be a letter, final match meeting or a call / virtual meeting and? Set expectations of your relationship moving forward that you and L_first_name are comfortable with. Acknowledge progress and growth you saw in the last 2 years. Recognize the challenges L_first_name has faced or overcame. Help L_first_name set goals for the future. Ask and help L_first_name to identify how she will accomplish her future goals and who all is in her support system going forward. Let me know when you have closed out the match and I will complete the final BBBS match closure check in with everyone. Also keep me posted if you have any questions. Wishing you a lovely summer!

CHILD/FAM FEELS INCOMPATIBLE W VOLUNTEER. In December 2021, PG reached out to MEC in anger and frustration that BS and LS had been on an outing at a pottery studio and LS had accidentally broken items, for which they were charged. PG reacted strongly to this and had a falling out with BS in-person during drop-off. PG felt that she couldn't trust LS with BS because BS wasn't firm enough with LS, was ""super nice"" but chose complicated activities and didn't set strong enough boundaries. MEC followed up with BS and BS felt that PG had treated her ""like a babysitter"" and LS was difficult to connect with because she didn't easily respond to boundary-setting. All agreed, with MEC intervention, that it was best to close the match after 'trust was lost.' PG would like for LS to be re-enrolled. BS would like to someday become a Big Sister to another Little, younger and with more compatibility. MEC talked with both about communication, trust, the unfortunate circumstances of this match closure and options for the future. (MEC also worked with BS, Match Support Director and VP of Programs to prioritize getting BS reimbursed for damaged items that she had been charged for at the pottery studio.) Rematch Child (Y/N): ????? *Reason: ?????Y, with conditions. LS is 12 y/o and according to both PG and BS, needs *firm* boundaries and a confident, experienced volunteer to connect in a match. MEC is consulting with EMT Director to talk through potential options for LS since she didn't get a chance to settle into a long term, positive match; her sister is in an active match, which also compels MEC to seek an option for LS. PG hoped for a rematch though admittedly has a strong temper and would need to demonstrate a willingness to communicate patiently and respectfully with any BS in the future. PG is highly motivated to have LS matched with a Big as a way to ""build trust with a healthy adult"" after challenging experiences in LS's earlier childhood. Rematch Volunteer (Y/N): ????? *Reason: ?????Y, with conditions. BS was very organized and planful; she sought partnership with PG and would benefit from a match with very open communication. She would also need to demonstrate flexibility and a willingness to recommit to a new match relationship, following program guidelines and a willingness to reconnect with another child and prioritize the match even among life's other happenings. BS would do best with a younger LS, from a structured home environment.

After being matched for 4 months, Little attended Big's home, as they were planning to cook dinner/bake. Little met Big's significant other and felt that she wasn't welcome into the home, as the SO did not speak to her. Mom addressed this with MEC and stated that she didn't know that Big has a SO and isn't too pleased about it. MEC coached Mom that bigs are allowed to be free in their social life and BBBS doesn't reject volunteers who have a relationship outside of BBBS. Mom was understanding but still had some hesitation. The match continued for another month, but Mom called back and shared that Little has stated that she wanted the match closed. MEC spoke with Little and Little shared that she feels unsafe and uncomfortable with Big Sister. When MEC asked why, she shared that after the last activity, she just doesn't feel comfortable with Big anymore. MEC asked if anything else happened during Big's place, and Little stated that nothing happened, she wasn't left alone, and Big was good to her, but she didn't like feeling unwelcome by Big's SO. MEC tried coaching Little that Big has a personal life, which she said she understands, but she doesn't like feeling ""unwelcome"". MEC couldn't proceed forward coaching Little, as Little started shutting down. MEC thanked Little and spoke with Mom. Mom shared that she wants her child to feel safe and welcome. Mom was adamant and would like the match closed. MEC spoke with Big Sister and asked about the activity taken at her location, and she shared that it went well. She said they made pizza and watched ""turning red"". MEC asked if Little was left alone at all during her time at Big's place, to which Big said ""no"". MEC also asked about Big's SO, which Big stated that he was there but he was in their room the majority of the time because he didn't want to conflict with their activity. MEC probe SO interacts with Little, to which Big said no. MEC shared that Little felt uncomfortable when she was at Big's place because of the SO. Big didn't have any idea, as the SO wasn't around them the majority of the time. When MEC shared that both Mom/Little would like the match closed, Big was taken back quite a bit. Big shared that she is unsure why Little would like the match closed as they were doing so well together but she also shared that she respects Little's decision as she also wants Little to feel comfortable and safe. Based on the information, MEC conclude the match is closed due to incompatibility.

Match came from GRU. A Series of situations arise during time matched at BBBS. 1. Grandma is upset that Monthly Contact is required, she wasn't happily checking in with MEC. Grandma has yelled at MEC for calling and texting her. 2. Little shared that she no longer wants to participate and ""focus on herself"". Grandma isn't fond of that idea (check MSC). Grandma wanted to wait for a month before the match closed. After a month, MEC called and checked back in, didn't get to speak with Little, but Grandma was persistent that Little wants to continue. After deliberating with Christine and Shadia from GRU, they both decided that they wanted the match closed. Without consulting with MEC, they connected with Grandma and shared that they are closing the match. MEC found out and had a meeting with GRU - after talking, everyone was on the same page. MEC also connected with a supervisor about match closing. Both GRU and Supervisor agree that the match should close due to the reason listed below. Match is closing because Match has not met for over 2.5 months, no communication, Little's lack of interest, Grandma's unwillingness to follow through with the program's rules/guidelines, and that MEC is being disrespected numerous times during MSC. MEC reached out and shared with Grandma that the match is closing via email. (Check Com log) MEC treats MEC differently compared to when she replied to all.

What really broke the camel's back was this past weekend when Big had to call the cops on PG for hitting Little. Big got a text from Little mentioning that PG was hitting her, so Big called CPS. PG mentioned that she didn't hit Little, but she does spank Little whenever she misbehaves or argues with PG. PG was very upset at Big for not even asking PG about the situation and just went straight to calling CPS. PG informed MEC that PG welcomed CPS in and they talked about the situation. There was nothing to report on the situation due to the lack of evidence and no visual bruises. Summarize any child safety concerns: Little SMS Big that she was getting hit by PG. Big called CPS on PG, PG told and showed CPS that there was no bruises or no harm to Little. Rematch Child (Y/N): ?? ???Yes Reason: ????She needs a lot of support. Rematch Volunteer (Y/N): ???No??

Summarize any child safety concerns: After reflection, along with discussion with supervisor and members of the enrollment team, I do not feel that Big is a threat. Little's report that Big put his hand on his shoulder and is always near him are not major red flags, but rather a mis-match of boundaries.

After discussing further with PG, MEC believes Little does not fully understand that a Big would be someone he doesn't know and has to build a relationship with. PG has also been quite nervous for the duration of the match due to Little's young age. MEC feels that if in a year or two the family is interested in a Big, they could be a good fit.

He explained that from the beginning it was tough to get BB to reach out. He isn't sure what was going on with BB but it seemed like maybe he was too busy or just not as invested. Dad said that LB and BB got together just a couple of times after they were matched and then they stopped hearing from BB. We talked through match completion; I explained the process; and Dad said that he was fine with that and didn't think LB needed to speak with me or have any questions. I asked about rematch (and that we can't promise anything but we could consider) and Dad said ""it worked for a little while"" but he didn't think the family needed the program at this point. He did compare notes about his other son's match, which was consistent and positive until BB moved to Colorado and it had to close. Dad said that he would recommend that BB ""in a heartbeat"" but he wouldn't recommend this BB (B_first_name) ""because he lacked ... follow through."" I told him I appreciated his honesty and we talked about the match having not met expectations. Dad is open to a closure letter/email and referral to other programs for LB (now 13 yo). When asked, he confirmed no questions, no concerns and nothing else that he needed to share about the experience. Dad confirmed match closure - BB lost contact with family/agency - and no interest in rematch at this time. BB is non-responsive to agency contact (see activity log) so match closure is now pending.

Match was overdue for contact and TPC was able to reach Dad 4/29/21 after several attempts at outreach. Dad explained that it had been ""months and months"" since they had any contact with BB, and ultimately BB and LB were only together a ""handful"" of times for the life of their match. This wasn't accounted for in the former coordinator's notes but TPC confirmed this to be true when talking with Dad on 4/29.

At first the match was virtual due to the pandemic. Then in the fall of 2021 they met in-person at Four Seasons Elementary School. B_first_name?s favorite activities with L_first_name were playing computer games on Zoom and playing Connect Four in-person. B_first_name said that at first it was hard to strike up a conversation with L_first_name but as they continued to meet L_first_name was excited to see him. Mitchel said their time together was positive and L_first_name even started to open up about personal things to him. In the winter of 2022 Branon was transitioned to an alternative learning school. L_first_name and B_first_name continued their meetings virtually. At the end of the 2022 school year B_first_name and PG lost contact. PC attempted to schedule a closure conversation with PG but could not get a hold of him either. PC made three attempts using three diffirent method of communications on three different days. PC had a closure conversation with B_first_name on 6/22/22. B_first_name said he liked the in-person and virtual activities in BBBS. He especially liked having a set time when the match could meet. To improve BBBS B_first_name suggested having a training for mentors on tips for helping Littles focus on Zoom. B_first_name added that he loved his volunteer experience with BBBS. 2) Summarize any child safety concerns: None. B_first_name did not have any safety concerns. He added that it was a ?hard to get a hold of PG.? PG list contact with the agency and Big Brother.  3) Rematch Child (Y/N): No. ? Reason: PG lost contact with agency. L_first_name no longer attends a school with a BBBS site-based program. 4) Rematch Volunteer (Y/N): No. ? Reason: B_first_name requested not to be rematched. He is headed into his senior year of college and is applying to medical school. If B_first_name ever applies to BBBS in the future PC would recommend having him back as a mentor. B_first_name was very patient with L_first_name who had ADHD. He was also coachable and stayed in-contact with the agency over the coarse of the match. ?

They completed their match meeting right before winter break. During St. Thomas J-term they did not meet. Most matches do not meet over J-term. When the spring semester started B_first_name Arykah did not resume her meetings with L_first_name. PC called, emailed, and texted B_first_name Arykah to check-in. See match activity log for attempts. Unfortunitely, at this time I do not think it is safe for the match to continue due to a lack of consistency and communication. I had a closure conversation with L_first_name in-person at Four Seasons on 3/28. L_first_name said she liked coloring with B_first_name Arykah. She described B_first_name Arykah as nice and said she made her smile. L_first_name put her head down as we spoke and used a quiet voice when we spoke. PC interpret this as her being sad the match did not work out. PC said it is okay to feel sad or disappointed that the match did not work out. I got the impression L_first_name had a great first meeting with B_first_name Arykah and wanted to keep being her Little Sister moving forward. PC emphasized that this is in no way L_first_name?s fault and she is not the reason the match is closing. PC said that we do not know everything that is going on with B_first_name Arykah. 2) Summarize any child safety concerns: L_first_name said she felt safe with her mentor. They technically only met one time. Mentor stopped showing up and communicating with BBBS.  3) Rematch Child (Y/N): Yes. 4) Reason: Expressed interest in being matched again.  5) Rematch Volunteer (Y/N): No. ? Reason: Mentor stopped showing up and communication with BBBS. PC would suggest not accepting B_first_name Arykah to be a mentor again for a bit. Her communication and follow through skills need improvement. Maybe in 3-4 years she will improve in this and then BBBS can reassess her for being a mentor.

They met for four school years in the BBBS site based program. B_first_name and L_first_name met at Four Seasons A+ Elementary School at first and then did pen pals over the pandemic. Then BB and LB resumed meeting at Four Seasons in the 2021-2022 school year. PC helped schedule a closure meeting for B_first_name and L_first_name on 5/10/22 at Four Seasons. PC coached BB and LB about closing the match well before the closure meeting. Unfortunately, PC could not attend the closure meeting on 5/10 due to COVID protocols. PC emailed B_first_name the list of closure questions B_first_name emailed PC a list of BB and LB answers. B_first_name and L_first_name?s favorite activity in BBBS was playing Guess who. L_first_name appreciated playing soccer with B_first_name and B_first_name appreciated watching L_first_name grow in communication with him and other students. To improve the BBBS program L_first_name suggested doing more activities like the blindfold maze challenge. B_first_name said, ?I think finding more ways to be active and moving around the classroom or gym would be beneficial, because some kids learn best by being hands on rather than reading or quizzes.? 2) Summarize any child safety concerns: No. BB emailed PC, ?No he is safe and makes good choices when I am with him. I am concerned about his home life a little bit, because he never brings up his family and dodges questions when family is involved.? PC emailed BB, ""In my experience in BBBS as caring adults we only hear about a sliver of home life. I've learned though that you need to give the benefit of the doubt to families though if you don't know anything.""  3) Rematch Child (Y/N): No ? Reason: L_first_name is graduating from 5th grade at Four Seasons A+ Elementary School. 4) Rematch Volunteer (Y/N): No. ? Reason: B_first_name is graduating from college and beginning his professional journey as a engineer. If B_first_name ever applied to be a mentor again I would highly recommend BBBS accept him back.

They met for three school years in the BSW Cargill program until COVID struck. B_first_name?s favorite activity with Princess was coloring. She also liked talking, using their imaginations, and making up stories. Princess? favorite activity was making sandwhiches for the homeless. B_first_name said Princess was very quiet at first and it was hard for them to have conversations. She enjoyed watching her grow in confidence and the ability to connect and conversate. Princess said she appreciated that Adrianna talked to her. She added that B_first_name made her feel better when she was not in a good mood. During the pandemic BS wrote LS letters to stay in touch. Unofrtunitly, PC was not able to make contct with PG to help LS write back. See attempts in activity log. At this point PC thinks it is best to close the match because it is not a two way conversation. PC had a closure conversation with B_first_name via the phone on 3/10/21. PC had a closure conversation with LS via the phone on 3/19/21. Even though PC got a hold of LS he still thought the best thing to do was close the match because LS is a 8th grade student and B_first_name is moving to Georgia. Adrianna and Princess did not have any suggestions ofr improving the BBBS Cargill program. B_first_name said she appreciated that BBBS brought kids to the office to meet and that this made it easy to volunteer. 2) Summarize any child safety concerns: None. B_first_name did not have any safety concerns regarding Princess and Princess said she always felt safe with B_first_name.  3) Rematch Child (Y/N): No. ? Reason: Princess will be graduating 8th grade this spring and going on to high school. 4) Rematch Volunteer (Y/N): No. ? Reason: B_first_name will be moving to back to Gerogria. Princess suggested BBBS re-accept B_first_name as a volunteer in the future because ?she was a good connection. We had a real connection.? PC would also re-accept B_first_name in a heartbeat in the future if she wished to be a volunteer. She did a great job of being patient, communication with LS and PC, and being dependable in her match. ? Should volunteer be red-flagged in AIM as a child safety concern (Y/N): No.",2017-11-13 00:00:00,,"MC thinks Princess is a good fit for a introverted Big Sister like B_first_name.

BS and LB were close and had a good match. LB and BS completed homework and actively engaged in the match activities. One place of growth for the match was around sharing power. LB always seemed to express an interest in playing basketball and seem disengaged when BS offered up other activities for match to try. After speaking to BS and LB about sharing power, match seemed to do better. Both LB and BS reported feeling that their choices were heard when they were with each other. BS began to miss meetings due to being on Varsity Badminton but wrote letters to stay in touch with LB. BS and LB had a good time in program and both grew in their time together. Match is unable to continue because LB and BS will both be transitioning to different schools in the fall. 2) Summarize any child safety concerns: There are no child safety concerns in the context of this match. 3) Rematch Child (Y/N): No ? Reason: LB is transitioning to middle school where programming is not offered. 4) Rematch Volunteer (Y/N): No ? Reason: BS is transitioning to college in the Fall of 2019. ?

They met for three school years in the BSW Cargill program. L_first_name?s favorite activity with B_first_name was playing Mancala. B_first_name?s favorite activity was going on walks with L_first_name at Cargill and talking. B_first_name liked getting away from other matches, and spending 1:1 time with L_first_name. Over the coarse of their match B_first_name witnessed L_first_name change from a child to a teenager. B_first_name and L_first_name?s match is closing because B_first_name is moving to Denver. MC had a closure conversation with B_first_name via the phone on 6/5/19. B_first_name gave MC permission to include her email address and phone number in the Closure Letter. MC had a closure conversation with L_first_name and Lashona (Mom) on 6/6/19. Lashonda thanked MC for allowing L_first_name to be BBBS, and added that L_first_name enjoyed building a relationship with B_first_name. MC said it was a pleasure to have L_first_name in the BSW Cargill program. L_first_name did not have any suggestions for improving the BSW Cargill program. B_first_name suggested BBBS use Barnes Park for the Cargill End of Year Celebration in the future. This park is closer to the Cargill EC Office. B_first_name also suggested BBBS allow Bigs to drive themselves to meetings off-site in the future, and not have mentors take a school bus. MC thanked B_first_name for this feedback. 2) Summarize any child safety concerns: None. B_first_name did not have any safety concerns regarding L_first_name, and L_first_name said she felt safe with B_first_name.  3) Rematch Child (Y/N): No. ? Reason: Lashonda said L_first_name will probably not be attending Harvest Prep next year. Also, L_first_name will be an eigth grade student in the fall of 2019. 4) Rematch Volunteer (Y/N): No. ? Reason: B_first_name is moving to Denver. L_first_name said BBBS should re-accpet B_first_name as a mentor in the future because, ?she?s a good big.

The match was together for two school years. There were some challenges in the first year, as LS was in Kindergarden and she really had trouble focusing on her match. The second year we better, but there were still challengs. BS did a great job of talking with MC regularly and giving it her all. In the end, the match just wasn?t successful, as LS seemed to enjoy getting out of class and getting to do fun stuff with her BS, but she didn?t seem real focused on the match or her time with BS. At the Big Day at the U event, LS refused to spend time with her BS, as she only wanted to run around with other kids. This was a common problem, as LS was always drawn to other kids and matches, not truly focuased on her time with BS. BS was very hurt by LS behavior at the U of M. BS gave the match a lot of time and she did an awesome job trying new things and communicating with MC, but in the end, the situation was too much and not working. 2) Summarize any child safety concerns: No child safety concerns.  3) Rematch Child (Y/N): No a. Reason: LS seemed to enjoy getting out of class, but she wasn?t really focused on building a relationship. She was seemed more interested in spending time with friends. 4) Rematch Volunteer (Y/N): Y ? Reason: When MC last spoke with BS, she was not sure about being rematched, as the situation with her last match took a lot out of her. MC would not hesitate to match BS in the future, as she did a wonderful job as a BS. She was dedicate, consistent, gave it her all, and she communicated well with MC. ?

They met in-person at Cargill for two school years until Covid-19 struck. PC completed a VMI with BS, LS, and PG in November of 2021. The plan was for them to meet virtually but following the VMI B_first_name was not able to connect/communicate with PG. BS and LS had not met since the VMI. At this point (in March of 2021) BS and PG agreed it was time to close the match. LS favorite activity was the marshmellow toothpick tower challenge. BS favorite activity was the unstructured meeting times. BS enjoyed watching LS grow in learning to control her outbursts and not letting everything control her mood. LS appreciated that BS was supportive, gave good advice, and was a good teacher. B_first_name and L_first_name did not have any suggestions for improving the BSW Cargill program. PC had a closure conversation with BS via the phone on 3/19/21. PC had a closure conversation with LS via the phone on 3/19/21 as well. 2) Summarize any child safety concerns: None. L_first_name said she always felt safe with B_first_name and B_first_name said she did not have any safety concerns regarding L_first_name.  3) Rematch Child (Y/N): No. ? Reason: L_first_name is in 9th grade. 4) Rematch Volunteer (Y/N): No. ? Reason: B_first_name expressed interest in being rematched in the BSW Cargill program. PC thinks B_first_name has been successful in this model and would be successful as a mentor again in the BSW Cargill program. L_first_name said she would suggest BBBS re-accept B_first_name as a volunteer because, ?I want others to experience what I experienced. I want them to have a good role model and have someone to talk to them and talk about what they can work on.?It is worth noting that PC sometimes had to make multiple attempts to connect/communicate with B_first_name. BBBS has instructed PC to not re-enroll any volunteers at this time. PC and B_first_name agreed to touch base in the summer of 2021 about re-enrollment. ?

They met in the educational programs program for four school years. Over the pandemic BS and LS continued their friendship with virtual meeting. They resumed in-person meetings in the fall of 2021 at Four Seasons. L_first_name?s favorite activities in BBBS were the marshmellow toothpick [STEM] challenge and the clay boat [STEM] challenge. B_first_name said her favorite activity in BBBS was playing Guess Who. One thing L_first_name appreciated about B_first_name was ?[the] time she made for me.? B_first_name appreciated looking forward to BBBS meetings over the coarse of their match. To improve BBBS L_first_name suggested having mentors stay longer in class and have BBBS give more activities to play with. B_first_name said having group meetings made BBBS exciting and suggested returning to group meetings to improve BBBS. L_first_name and B_first_name were an excellent candidate for the CB program and that was the plan until PG informed PC that they would be ending the match. 2) Summarize any child safety concerns: None. B_first_name did not have any safety concerns regarding L_first_name and L_first_name said she always felt safe with B_first_name.  3) Rematch Child (Y/N): No. ? Reason: PG said she spoke to LS and LS said she did not want to continue the match. 4) Rematch Volunteer (Y/N): No. ? Reason: B_first_name is moving back to Shakopee.

They met at Cargill for two years until COVID struck. Over the pandemic BS and LS remained in touch via pen pals. The match is closing because L_first_name graduated from 8th grade and will not be at a site-based school next year. PC scheduled a closure meeting for BS & LS on 5/25/21 over the phone. Unfortunately, when PC and BS called they could not reach PG or LS. Communication with LS family has been off and on and her PG does not speak much English. PC thinks it would be best to close to match at this point. PC had a closure conversation with B_first_name virtually on 5/25/21. PC had a closure conversation with L_first_name via the phone on 6/15/21. B_first_name said her favorite activity in BBBS was when the Littles visited the Cargill food innovation center. L_first_name said her favorite activity was visiting B_first_name?s workplace and walking around her building. LS appreciated that BS taught her about work, where she works, and how she works with others. B_first_name appreciated exposing L_first_name to more things and seeing her open up more and more. B_first_name also appreciated that L_first_name was accepting of their differences. B_first_name did not have any suggestions for improving the BBBS program. She thought BBBS was a great program and liked the outings off site, especially bowling. B_first_name also liked introducing Littles to a business environment. L_first_name did not have any suggestions for improving the BBBS program as well. PC helped LS write BS a farewell letter, and invited BS to write a farewell letter to LS as well. 2) Summarize any child safety concerns: None. B_first_name did not have any safety concerns for L_first_name and L_first_name said she always felt safe with B_first_name.  3) Rematch Child (Y/N): No. ? Reason: L_first_name graduated from 8th grade and is not attending a site-based school next year. She is also 13 years old. 4) Rematch Volunteer (Y/N): No. ? Reason: B_first_name requested to take time off of volunteering for the moment. L_first_name suggested BBBS re-accept her as a volunteer in the future.

They met for two schools at Cargill until COVID struck. Over the pandemic BS and LS were pen pals and corresponded back and forth. I delivered B_first_names letters to L_first_name?s family because they did not have a mailing address. Their match is closing because L_first_name no longer attends Harvest Prep and L_first_name?s family had lost contact with the agency. I had a closure conversation with B_first_name via the phone on 11/10/21. B_first_name and I agreed the best thing to do is close the match. B_first_name?s favorite activity with L_first_name was playing games. When they played games, L_first_name?s personality came out and they could chitchat. B_first_name also liked playing football outside with L_first_name. Football was one of L_first_name?s interests. B_first_name enjoyed watching L_first_name open up more as their meetings progressed. B_first_name said L_first_name was always shy at first in meetings but would open up which was great to see. B_first_name shared that BBBS over COVID was hard. She appreciated the balance of structured activities and unstructured activities in BBBS and added that unstructured time helped L_first_name be more herself.

PC had a closure conversation with L_first_name and B_first_name at Four Seasons on 5/13/22. L_first_name?s favorite activity with B_first_name was the marshmellow toothpick challenge. B_first_name said her favorite activity was when they got choice time and could pick what they wanted to do. B_first_name said she has appreciated watching L_first_name grow in her care of others over the course of their match. She added that L_first_name was asking her how she is doing during meetings this school year. L_first_name appreciated that ?[B_first_name] has always been there for me.? To improve the BBBS program B_first_name said she liked 1:1 meetings more than group meetings. She added that 1:1 meetings are more personal and they were able to connect more during this time. L_first_name suggested having more community outings to improve the BBBS program. 2) Summarize any child safety concerns: None.

They met weekly in-person at Four Seasons Elmentary School until COVID struck in March of 2020. Over the pandemic BS and LS were pen pals. Their match is closing because B_first_name is not vaccinated and she is not interested in taking weekly COVID tests to meet with L_first_name Lar Law Paw at Four Seasons. PC offered continuing the match virtually or via pen pals but B_first_name declined these options and said she would like to close the match. PC professional judgement was to not attempt a closure meeting. B_first_name and L_first_name L_last_name have not seen each other each other in a year and a half. At this point I think having a closure meeting might do more harm then good. PC had a closure conversation with L_first_name Law Law Paw in-person at Four Seasons on 11/3/21. L_first_name L_last_name?s favorite activity with B_first_name was building marshmellow towers. L_first_name L_last_name appreciated that B_first_name always let her pick the first game they played. She could not think of any suggestions to improve BBBS. PC had a closure conversation with B_first_name via the phone on 11/3/21. B_first_name?s favorite activity with L_first_name L_last_name was also marshmellow tower building. She liked how they had to communicate during this activity about how they were going to build their tower. B_first_name also enjoyed watching L_first_name L_last_name warm up to her over the coarse of their match. B_first_name said L_first_name L_last_name was nervious to speak English to her at first. L_first_name L_last_name is a English language learner and I think B_first_name helped L_first_name L_last_name practice having conversations in English. B_first_name gave PC permission to include her email and phone number in the closure lerrer. She did not have any suggestions for improving the BBBS program. B_first_name said she liked the BBBS system a lot and that being a BBBS volunteer was fun and fulfilling. 2) Summarize any child safety concerns: None. L_first_name Law Lar always felt safe with B_first_name and B_first_name said she did not have any safety concerns regarding L_first_name L_last_name.  3) Rematch Child (Y/N): Yes. ? Reason: L_first_name L_last_name wants to be re-matched. I think B_first_name and L_first_name L_last_name?s match was very positive for her. The fact that she warmed up to a mentor also is a good sign for a re-match. I think re-matching L_first_name L_last_name would be a positive experience for her. 4) Rematch Volunteer (Y/N): No. ? Reason: B_first_name is not vaccinated and not willing to take weekly COVID tests. If B_first_name applied to be a mentor in the future I would accept her application as long as she agreed to follow any COVID safety protocals/prcedures. ? Should volunteer be red-flagged in AIM as a child safety concern (Y/N): No.,2019-10-29 00:00:00,,B_first_name and L_first_name L_last_name both like drawing and coloring.

MC emailed Grey a Closure Letter Big on 5/21/19. See activity log for full details. Match Closure Summary 1) Describe the reasons for closure and any extenuating circumstances: L_first_name and B_first_name (Grey) were matched in October of 2017. They met for two school years in the BSW Cargill program. Their match is closing because L_first_name is graduating from eigth grade, and will be going to a different school next year. MC spoke to Grey in the spring of 2019 and discussed the different options for the match (community based, closing the match and exchanging contact information, closing the match and not exchanging contact information, etc.). After talking it over, Grey and MC agreed that it would be best to close the match at the end of the 2018-2019 school year. Grey gave MC permission to include his email address and cell phone number in a Closure Letter to L_first_name and his parents. L_first_name and Grey hope to stay in-touch informally in the future. MC had a closure conversation with L_first_name and Grey during the BSW Cargill End of the Year celebration on 5/20/19. L_first_name?s favorite activity with Grey was playing chess. Grey?s favorite activity with L_first_name was also playing chess. Grey added that L_first_name was shy at first, and he has enjoyed watching L_first_name grow socially. Now, L_first_name is very comfortable talking to other people. L_first_name and Grey did not have any suggestions for imrpoving the BSW Cargill program. MC thinks L_first_name and Grey ended the school year, and their match, on a good note. 2) Summarize any child safety concerns: None. L_first_name said she always felt safe with Grey. Grey did not have any safety concerns regarding L_first_name.  3) Rematch Child (Y/N): No. ? Reason: L_first_name will be graduating 8th grade this spring, and moving on to a new school next year. 4) Rematch Volunteer (Y/N): Yes. ? Reason: Grey expressed interest in getting re-matched. Grey did a great job of building a relationship with L_first_name, and returning MC calls/emails promptly. Grey was easy going/flexible in his match. L_first_name suggested BBBS re-accept Grey as a volunteer in the future because, ?he?s amazing?he is a cool person [with] chill vibes.? ? Should volunteer be red-flagged in AIM as a child safety concern (Y/N): No.",2017-10-31 00:00:00,2019-05-20 00:00:00,MC said he thought Grey and L_first_name would be a good match because they both like sports.

Their meetings were semi-consistent and at one point BS and LS meetings stopped because LS went to live in Nashville. Then, their meetings restarted when she returned. The match is closing because PG and LS lost contact with BS and PC. PC thinks COVID played a factor into this disconnect, so he labeled the match closure reason as COVID-Impact. PC made three attempts to contact L_first_name and PG on 6/28, 7/19, & 7/21. PC had a closure conversation with Susie via email on 7/26/21. Susie said her favorite activities with L_first_name were talking about school and home life, mancala, connect 4, and Spot-it. She wrote that over the match L_first_name, ?became so much more confident, talkative, and mature in the 3 years we knew each other.

See activity log for full details. Match Closure Summary 1) Describe the reasons for closure and any extenuating circumstances: Allie and L_first_name were matched in December of 2017. They met for two school years in the BSW Cargill program. Their match closed because L_first_name is graduating from eigth grade, and she will be going to a different school next year. MC spoke to Allie in the spring of 2019 and discussed the different options for the match (community based, closing the match and exchanging contact information, etc). Allie and MC agreed that it would be best to close the match at the end of the 2018-2019 school year, and then for Allie and L_first_name to exchange contact information and stay in-touch informally. MC had a closure conversation with Allie and L_first_name during the BSW Cargill End of the Year celebration on 5/20/19. L_first_name?s favorite activity with Allie was 1:1 time when they could talk. Allie?s favorite activity with L_first_name was also 1:1 time when they could connect/talk. Allie added that she has enjoyed watching L_first_name grow, especially in regards to how she treats others. Allie made it clear that she does not approve of students talking bad/gossiping about other students. MC thinks this is one of the many ways Allie was a good role model to L_first_name. Allie and L_first_name did not have any suggestions for imrpoving the BSW Cargill program. Allie gave MC permission to include her email and cell phone number in the Little Closure Letter. MC thinks Allie and L_first_name ended the school year, and their match, on a good note. 2) Summarize any child safety concerns: None. L_first_name said she always felt safe with Allie. Allie did not have any safety concerns regarding L_first_name.  3) Rematch Child (Y/N): No. ? Reason: L_first_name will be graduating 8th grade this spring, and moving on to a new school next year. 4) Rematch Volunteer (Y/N): No. ? Reason: Allie hesitated when MC brought up getting re-matched in the BSW Cargill program next year. MC is planning to reach out to Allie again, and inquire if she is interested in getting re-matched.

They met for one school year at Four Seasons until COVID struck. Over the pandemic BS and LS met virtually and continued their friendship. B_first_name?s favorite activity in BBBS was drawing and a music making online activity. L_first_name?s favorite activity was painting and the music making activity too. BS enjoyed watching LS open up and talk more over their match. She liked getting to know L_first_name more and see her grow in future thinking and thinking about her interets. L_first_name said she appreciated that B_first_name gave her ?honest opinions.? She added that B_first_name ?opened meethings with a Big smile? and they talked a lot. L_first_name added that activities were fun and their time together was respectful. BS and LS match is closing because L_first_name graduated from Four Seasons Elementary School and will not be at a site-based school next year. PC talked with B_first_name about the options for the match (continue virtually, community based, close the match). B_first_name chose closing the match because it would add flexibility to their relationship. BS and LS plan to stay in-touch informally and continue their friendship in this way. They already have each others contact information as a virtual match. BS is also graduating this December. B_first_name did not have any suggestions for improving the BBBS program. She said the virtual activity suggestions were very helpful and when they were meeting in-person she liked the balance of choice time and planned activitys. L_first_name did not have any suggestions for improving the program. At the match closure meeting it was clear that BBBS was a positive experience for BS & LS and they grew in the program. L_first_name and B_first_name mutually appreciated each other. 2) Summarize any child safety concerns: None. B_first_name said she did not have any safety concerns regarding L_first_name and L_first_name said she always felt safe with B_first_name.  3) Rematch Child (Y/N): No. ? Reason: L_first_name no longer attends a site-based school. PC spoke to PG about how to enroll LS in the community based program and passed along the website to enroll a child. PG said she plans to talk to LS about this and see what she thinks. If L_first_name applies to the community based program PC highly suggests she is accepted. PC can see LS forming another special connection with a caring adult. 4) Rematch Volunteer (Y/N): No. ? Reason: B_first_name is graduating from college this December. L_first_name said BBBS should accept B_first_name in the future as a volunteer because she respects people, tells the truth, is very welcoming, and has a calm energy. PC would agree and a highly suggest B_first_name be accepted in the future if she applies again. She went above and beyond as a virtual mentor and did a great job of forming a caring friendship with a child. ?

They met for one school year at Cargill until COVID struck. Right before the pandemic L_first_name?s four year old niece passed away in a drowning accident. B_first_name had a braclet with L_first_name?s nieces initials made and PC mailed this along to L_first_name. B_first_name and L_first_name were in-touch during the pandemic via pen pal letters. L_first_name?s Parent/Guardian changed during her match. B_first_name and L_first_name?s match is closing because L_first_name will not be attending the Harvest Prep Network of Schools next year. PC organized a closure conversation via the phone for BS and LS on 6/29/21. L_first_name said her favorite activity was ?hanging out with my Big Sister and doing activities.?

B_first_name said her favorite activity was going outside and playing Frisbee with L_first_name. She also liked showing L_first_name her floor at Cargill. B_first_name witnessed L_first_name blossom over their match. She was shy at first but started to show more of her personality as they continued to meet. B_first_name did not have any suggestions for improving the BBBS program. She noted that the last year had been unusual with the pandemic and the program would have been better if they could have met in-person. 2) Summarize any child safety concerns: No. L_first_name said she always felt safe with B_first_name. B_first_name did not have any safety concerns.  3) Rematch Child (Y/N): No. ? Reason: L_first_name will no longer be attending the Harvest Prep Network of Schools. She is also 12 years old. It is also worth noting that it was challenging to communicate with Jocelyn Hammonds (L_first_name?s New PG). 4) Rematch Volunteer (Y/N): Yes. ? Reason: I would rematch B_first_name in the future if she wanted to be a mentor again. This match took a number of twists and turns and B_first_name handled them gracefully. She was a positive influence to L_first_name, and L_first_name suggested BBBS re-accept her as a volunteer because she is ?kind and nice.?

They met in person at Cargill until March of 2020 when the pandemic struck. Over the pandemic B_first_name and L_first_name were pen. Most of this communication was one sided from B_first_name to L_first_name. Their match is closing because L_first_name moved and is no longer attending Harvest Prep. L_first_name shared with PG that she would be moving at the end of October. PC had a closure conversation with Anihya at Harvest Prep. L_first_name said her favorite activity in BBBS was talking to B_first_name about her kids and the trips she had been on. L_first_name appreciated that B_first_name was able to communicate and that they took turns picking games/activities. She suggested more trips to improve the BBBS BSW program. I waited to close the match until L_first_name had definitely moved. I made three attempts on 11/2, 11/3, and 11/4 to schedule a closure meeting or see if LS could continue the match virtually. However, PG lost contact with the agency. I had a closure conversation with B_first_name via the phone on 11/4/21. B_first_name?s favorite activity in BBBS were the art projects. She said that L_first_name was super competitive which made playing Connect 4 fun too. B_first_name noticed that at the start of the match L_first_name would speak before she was thinking and later in the match she was getting better at thinking before she spoke. B_first_name did not have any suggestions for improving the BBBS program. She said BBBS is doing an ?amazing job?and fills a need.? 2) Summarize any child safety concerns: None. L_first_name said she always felt safe with B_first_name and B_first_name said she did not have any safety concerns regarding L_first_name.  3) Rematch Child (Y/N): No. ? Reason: Family moved and lost contact with agency. 4) Rematch Volunteer (Y/N): Yes. ? Reason: B_first_name wishes to be re-matched.

B_first_name and L_first_name?s were matched in November of 2019. They met for 26 months which included time at Four Seasons and being pen pals over the pandemic. B_first_names favorite activity with L_first_name was making braclets and coloring. L_first_name?s favorite activity was also braclet making. B_first_name enjoyed watching L_first_name become more expressive over their match. She noted that LS beat BS in every game they played. L_first_name said she appreciated B_first_name?s kind words. She added that if she said a bad word her Big Sister would tell her not to say that and she appreciated that. PC had a closure conversation with BS in-person on 12/14/21. PC also held a closure meeting for BS and LS on 12/14/21. During the closure meeting L_first_name was silent. B_first_name was able to share with L_first_name how she enjoyed their time together and she said goodbye. PC had a closure conversation with L_first_name in-person at Four Seasons A+ Elementary School on 1/4/21. B_first_name said the BBBS program was pretty good and she did not have any suggestions for improving the program. L_first_name did not have any suggestions for improving the program as well. B_first_name gave PC permission to share her phone number with PG to informally stay in touch with LS. 2) Summarize any child safety concerns: B_first_name said she did not have any safety concerns regarding L_first_name and L_first_name said she she always felt safe with B_first_name. My experience was that L_first_name had a challenging time following adult direction. She even left the BBBS classrooms a few times without asking. She would wonder the halls and then come back. L_first_name also had some unqique behavior concerns. She poked herself with a pin during a BBBS meeting and did need to return to class a few BBBS meetings because she did not follow the BBBS rules. I do not have any other safety concerns.  3) Rematch Child (Y/N): No. ? Reason: L_first_name is a fifth grader and will be graduating from Four Seasons A+ this spring. I would also not recommend her for a community based match because her PG was challenging to communicate with over the pandemic.

They met at Four Seasons Elementary School until COVID started. At the start of COVID BS wrote letters to LS to stay in touch. PC was able to facilitate a VMI for their B_first_name and L_first_name in November of 2020 and they started to meet virtually weekly. However, it sounds like communicating with PG was sometimes challenging and sometimes L_first_name did not login to meetings. In February of 2021 PG messaged PG to close the match. She said nothing was wrong with the match but she did not want to waste B_first_name?s time any longer. PC tried to dig deeper and see if they could transition the match to a program that would be successful for BS and LS. PG stated very clearly she wanted to close the match. PG made three attempts to contact PG and LS to schedule a closure meeting and have a closure conversation. See activity log for attempts. Unfortunitely, PC lost contact with PG. PC had a closure conversation with B_first_name via the phone on 3/8/21. Kaitelyn said her favorite activity in BBBS happened recently. L_first_name had been writing songs with her cousin. LS was sharing and performing these songs during virtual meetings. BS enjoyed watching LS grow in confidence as she shared these songs. Kaityln also noted that L_first_name had been growing in taking more responsibility over their match. BS said she did not have any suggestions for improving the BBBS program. It has been a ?whirlwind of a experience? with COVID but she thinks BBBS has done the best it can given the circumstances. B_first_name did note that virtual meetings were easier for her because they allowed more flexibility. 2) Summarize any child safety concerns: No, Kaitelyn did not have any safety cocnerns.  3) Rematch Child (Y/N): No. ? Reason: PG withdrew LS and lost contact with agency. 4) Rematch Volunteer (Y/N): No. ? Reason: BS cannot commit to meeting with another Little at this time. She will be applying to medical school and her courses are becoming more challenging. PC thanked BS for critically thinking about the time/sacrifice it takes to be a mentor. If Kaitleyn ever applies to be a mentor again in the future PC would recommend BBBS re-accept her (based on this match). ?

PC tried to set up a meeting after school was done for the summer, but PC was never able to connect with BL?s family. When school resumed, PC connected with LB and he was no longer interested in meeting with his BB, as he just wanted to spend time with his friends. LB?s decision actually worked out for the best, as BB also decided to retired from the Maplewood Police Department. BB has said he would have made it work, had LB been really excited about continuing, but he felt things fell into place with the match closure. Overall, they had a good match and got along great. PC spoke with both LB and BB about a closure meeting. BB was open to it, if LB wanted to. LB wasn't interested and said he didn't need to have one more meeting to say goodbye or anything.
